## description
#### AstraRise was my first step into the world of creative web experiments, and also my first recognized work on Awwwards. I wanted to build something that felt alive, something that breathes when you interact with it. That's how AstraRise was born — a digital galaxy that reacts, moves, and shifts with every touch. The site lets you explore space through motion — twist the colors, adjust the density of stars, and shape your own universe in real time. It's built using Three.js for 3D visualization, GSAP for animation, and Tailwind CSS for a clean, fluid design. AstraRise isn't just a visual experiment; it's a personal milestone — the project that taught me how imagination can become recognition.
